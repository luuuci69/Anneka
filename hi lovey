Dear [Anneka],

As Valentine's Day draws near, I find myself wanting to share it with someone who means the world to me. Someone who fills my heart with joy and makes every moment special. That someone is you.

Will you be my Valentine?

I can't imagine a better way to celebrate love than with you by my side. Whether it's a romantic dinner, a cozy movie night, or simply spending time together, I know it will be unforgettable.

Please say yes and make my Valentine's Day dreams come true!

With all my love,
[Khalil]
